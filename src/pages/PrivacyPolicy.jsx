          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Consent:</strong> Where you have freely and

            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Contract:</strong> Where processing is necessary
              to provide a service you request or fulfil an agreement
              with you.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Legal obligation:</strong> Where processing is
              necessary to comply with applicable laws or lawful
              regulatory requirements.

            <li>
              <strong>Vital interests or other lawful grounds:</strong>

          <p className="mt-2">
            Where automated processing is used, we will apply
            appropriate safeguards. Where applicable law gives
            you the right to request human intervention, express
            your views or challenge a decision based solely on
            automated processing, you may exercise that right.

            We will provide additional information where a particular
            automated decision has legal or similarly significant
